# ESP8266-Based Weather Monitoring System

## Overview :
This project is an IoT-based weather monitoring system built using the ESP8266 microcontroller. The system captures real-time weather data from various sensors, including the BMP280 for pressure and temperature, the DHT11 for humidity and temperature, and a rain sensor. The collected data is wirelessly transmitted and displayed on a web interface, making it easy to monitor environmental conditions from any device.

## Features :

->Real-Time Data: Provides instant updates on temperature, humidity, pressure, and rainfall.

->Wireless Connectivity: Utilizes the ESP8266â€™s Wi-Fi capabilities to transmit data to a web server.

->Web Interface: Accessible dashboard for viewing live weather data.

->Sensor Integration: Incorporates BMP280, DHT11, and rain sensors for comprehensive weather monitoring.

Components Used :

->ESP8266: The main microcontroller for data processing and Wi-Fi connectivity.

->BMP280: Measures atmospheric pressure and temperature.

->DHT11: Captures humidity and temperature data.

->Rain Sensor: Detects the presence of rainfall.

This is how my web app interface looks like :
